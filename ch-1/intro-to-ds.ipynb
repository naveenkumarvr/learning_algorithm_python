    "### defaultdict\n",
    "    - The default dictionary(defaultdict) is a subclass of the build in dictionary class(dict) that has the same method and operation as the dictionary class, with the only difference being that it is never raises a KeyError as normal dictionary would. \n",
    "    - DefaultDict is the convenient way to initialize dictionaries\n",
    "    - Syntax:\n",
    "        d = defaultdict(def_values)\n",

    "### Counter\n",
    "    - The hashtable is the object whose hash value will remain the same during its lifetime in the program. The counter is use to count the number of hashtable objects\n",
    "    - For example dictionary key is the hash objects and corresponding value is the count of the object. \n",
    "    - In other words, 'counter' object create a hash table in which the element and their count are stored as dictionary keys and value pairs.\n",
    "    - Example: \n",
    "        from collections import Counter\n",
