    "**- It is important to note that for each iteration half of the search space is discarded, which improves the performance of the overall algorithm because there are fewer elements to search through**\n",
    "- In the below example the binary search needs 4 attempt to search number 13. If we double the list size it only need 5 attempt as on the 1st search the size of the list is cut in to half\n",
    "**- So We say that when we have a list of length n the number of search required will be the number of times we repeated halving the list until we are left with 1 element plus 1 which is mathematically equal to (log2 n + 1). For example if n=8 the output will be 3**\n",
    "- The list is divided in half in each iteration; with the divide-and-conquer strategy, the worst-case time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n)"
