Similarly Dynamic programming also divides the problem in to sub problems and get the outcome for the bigger problem with two differences\n",

    "    - i.e, An Optimal Substructure means that the optimal solution of the problem can be obtained from optimal solution of its sub-problem.\n",
    "    - Example: The Fibonacci value of 6 fib(6) can be computed by solving sub problems of fib(5) and fib(4). i.e the ith Fibonacci number from its series can be computed from (i-1) and (i-2) \n",
    "- **Overlapping sub-problem**\n",
    "    - If an algorithm solves the same problem again and again then the problem have the overlapping sub-problem. \n",
    "    - Example: fib(5) will have multiple times computations for fib(3) and fib(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the problem have above characteristics then dynamic programming approach is useful as the implementation can be improved by reusing the same solution computed before. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the dynamic programming we divide a given problem into smaller sub problem. In recursion also we divide the problem into smaller sub problems, However the difference between recursion and dynamic programming is that similar sub problems can be solved any number of times but in dynamic programming we keep track of previous solved sub problems and we take care not to recompute the previously encountered sub problems again. **One property that makes a problem an ideal candidate for being solve with dynamic programming is that it has an overlapping set of sub-problems.**\n",
